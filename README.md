# Module-2-Stock-Analysis

# Overview of Project
-The background of this was to help our friend to be able to find out at a glance what starts are the best to look at and to make it easy and fast. 

# Results
-The challenge was a success and I was able to cut the processing time in half from what it was originally taking, and we are able to very easily to see and pick the stocks we want to look at. 

# Summary
-I feel like the results were rather lack luster from the refactoring, as it took us 2x the amount of time to save half a second on the code processing time. not an amazing ROI on your time. (I know its for a challenge, but in the real world that would be a real factor in my opinion.) If it was something that was taking say 30 minutes a day to run and we cut it in half you would make that time up pretty quickly, but in something that fast, the best way to do it in my opion is it do it once and forget about it. But the results do in fact speak for themselves.

-The advantages to the first round of code is that it was much easier for us to read and for us to be able to run. Since it was a one and done issue that was already running fast enough, I think it was more than worth it to leave it be and and to add on features if you want to add and improve the report
